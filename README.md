# Exxeta Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025

## 🤖 AI Staffing System with Multi-Agent AI

### 📄 Problem Statement:

In this hackathon, the challenge is to build a service or application that connects consultants with fitting projects using Multi-Agent AI Systems. Tech students are invited to explore how intelligent agent collaboration can bridge the gap between individual profiles and project needs, creating smarter, more dynamic connections.

Whether through **skill-based matching**, **smart recommendations**, or **automated coordination**, the goal is to let AI assist in establishing meaningful partnerships. The challenge encourages experimentation with agent roles and coordination strategies to create efficient and intelligent staffing processes.
