# Exxeta Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025

## 🤖 AI Staffing System with Multi-Agent AI

### 📄 Problem Statement:

In this hackathon, the challenge is to build a service or application that connects consultants with fitting projects using Multi-Agent AI Systems. Tech students are invited to explore how intelligent agent collaboration can bridge the gap between individual profiles and project needs, creating smarter, more dynamic connections.

Whether through **skill-based matching**, **smart recommendations**, or **automated coordination**, the goal is to let AI assist in establishing meaningful partnerships. The challenge encourages experimentation with agent roles and coordination strategies to create efficient and intelligent staffing processes.

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

Open two separate terminals to execute the **Frontend** and **Backend** setup processes.

### 🌐 Frontend Setup

1. **Change directory to the Frontend Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/49160/Downloads/QHack/frontend

2. **Install local npm dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev

4. **Visit the provided URL to access the frontend application.**

### 🌐 Backend Setup

1. **Change directory to the Backend Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd /c/Users/49160/Downloads/QHack/backend

2. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    env\Scripts\activate

4. **Install dependencies from requirements.txt:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Execute the API controller file:**
    ```bash
    python api_controller.py

### 💡 Final Notes

- Ensure you have **Python** (version ≥ `3.10.0'), Node.js (version ≥ `v18.14.1`), and npm (version ≥ `9.3.1`) installed on your system.
- Keep both **frontend** and **backend** terminals running during development.
- You may adjust the **folder paths** if your local directory structure is different.
